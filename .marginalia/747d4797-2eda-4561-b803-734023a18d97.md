# Import error

So, as you are probably aware, there's a bit of an issue with imports, especially inside `Routes.tsx`. Another fun thing I found here, I tried exporting `import { PriceBox } from "@/landingPage";` and it broke. That being said, it stops breaking the app, for some reason, when I import as so:

```ts
// BREAKING
import { PriceBox } from "@/landingPage/components/sections";

// WORKING
import { PriceBox } from "@/landingPage/components/sections/pricingSection";
```

Maybe because it was `export { PriceBox, LandingPage } from "./components"` in `/src/landingPage/index.ts`

EDIT: Nevermind, even in @/Core, I am forced to reach to the component
